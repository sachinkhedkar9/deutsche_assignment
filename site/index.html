    <h1>Updating Table</h1>

    <h2>Your Task</h2>

    <h3>1. A Sorted table</h3>

    <p>
        Show those currency pairs in a table with rows for each currency pair, which
        includes columns for at least the name, the current best bid price, current best ask price,
        the amount that the best bid last changed, and the amount the best ask price last changed.
        This data can be read out of the price updates that are sent via stomp.   There are a limited number
        of currency pairs, and multiple updates will be sent for each one.  You should request the topic
        <code>/fx/prices</code>, to receive update messages with a body that looks like this:
    </p>

<pre></pre>

  <table>
      <thead>
          <tr>
              <td>Name</td>
              <td>usdjpy</td>
          </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody id="sortableTable">

      </tbody>
  </table>





















    <h3>2. Sparklines</h3>

    <p>
        The last column should be a live updating sparkline which shows the midprice over the last 30 seconds.  The
        x axis should be time. The midprice can be calculated by adding the bestBid and bestAsk fields together and
        dividing by 2.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can get a new element with a spark line drawn in it like so:

    <pre>
    const sparks = document.createElement('span')
    Sparkline.draw(sparks, [1, 2, 3, 4])
    </pre>

        Or you can get a sparkline that you can repeatedly update with rendered values:

    <pre>
    const sparkElement = document.createElement('span')
    const sparkline = new Sparkline(sparkElement)
    sparkline.draw([1,2,3,4,5])
    /** sometime later... */
    sparkline.draw([2,3,4,5,1])
    </pre>

        Here's an example sparkline: <span id="example-sparkline"></span>
</pre>

    </p>
